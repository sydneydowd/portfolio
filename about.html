<div class="bio">
  <p class="kilo">Hello, Iâ€™m Sydney. I was born and raised in Ottawa ON. Growing up I was always exposed to the design world with family members in the feild. In High School I focused on the arts and I am now a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College currently in my final year following my dreams to become a designer. I'm a problem solver and creative thinker with a passion for design. My designs are minimal but strong because of my use of simplictic design and bold colours. I beleive that design with purpose is successful design. </p>
