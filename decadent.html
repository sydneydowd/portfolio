  <p>This package design for Decadent Cookies was geared toward children. My goal was to have kids pick Decadent Cookies off the shelf over their competitors. To do so I came up with the idea of a Cookie Monster Box. When you open the box you open the monsters mouth with the cookies inside. It's a fun way for children to interact with the box and have fun with friends. I decided to do three versions to gear towards both male and female, and have them as collectable items</p>
